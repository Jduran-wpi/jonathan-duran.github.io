# Information Security Posture – Final Assessment

## By Jonathan Duran and MIS 582 Team

### Team Members: Humberto Martínez, Justin Cabral, Jonathan Duran

### Date: April 22, 2022

As part of a graduate-level project for MIS582 - Information Security Management, I, Jonathan Duran, collaborated with Justin Cabral and Humberto Martinez to assess the information security posture of the Rhode Island College (RIC) Helpdesk. Drawing on both our academic knowledge and prior experience as student technicians at the Helpdesk, our team conducted a thorough analysis across multiple security domains, including authentication, access control, network security, cryptography, and physical security.

We identified a range of strengths, such as network segmentation and structured remote support systems. However, critical vulnerabilities were also present—such as the use of outdated operating systems, unsecured hard drives containing sensitive data, shared user accounts, and inconsistent physical access control. These issues posed serious risks to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Our recommendations focused on implementing multi-factor authentication, migrating off legacy systems, encrypting retired drives, improving logging and auditing procedures, and enhancing physical and network access restrictions. We also emphasized the development of a comprehensive security awareness program tailored to both full-time and student workers to instill stronger security practices and accountability.

The project culminated in actionable proposals aimed at improving RIC Helpdesk’s security maturity through collaborative engagement with campus IT leadership, practical policy changes, and a cost-benefit perspective on cybersecurity investment.
