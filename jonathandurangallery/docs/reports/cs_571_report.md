## By Jonathan Duran and CS571 Team

### Team Members: Humberto Martínez, Justin Cabral, Jonathan Duran, Shary Llanos, Antonio

### Date: March 23, 2022

Our comprehensive case study analyzes the May 2021 ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline Company, one of the most disruptive cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. The attack, carried out by the Darkside ransomware group, exploited outdated VPN systems and led to the shutdown of pipeline operations, causing fuel shortages across the eastern United States.

This report covers the full timeline of the attack, methods used, key vulnerabilities, and the wide-ranging technical, human, and business factors that contributed to the breach. We also explore the broader significance of the incident for cybersecurity in critical infrastructure, drawing key lessons for organizations to prevent similar intrusions.

Highlights include:

Breakdown of the attack method and exploited vulnerabilities

Analysis of organizational failures in cybersecurity governance

Importance of securing legacy systems and enabling multi-factor authentication

Recommendations based on NIST's updated risk management framework

This case study emphasizes the urgent need for modernized cybersecurity practices in high-value targets and offers actionable insights for future defense against ransomware threats.
